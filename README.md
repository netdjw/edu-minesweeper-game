# Minesweeper game in Vanilla JavaScript

I crated this code to explain loops, if-else statements, functions & DOM in practice.

This code demostrate how less coding enough to create a usable & fun application. 

This code is free to use, copy, modify, fork, etc.

Please star it, if you like this code!

Thanks!
